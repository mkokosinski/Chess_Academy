* My website is a chess learning platform built using HTML, CSS, React, TypeScript, and libraries such as react-chessboard, chess.js, and framer-motion. It offers users the ability to solve various chess puzzles at different difficulty levels, allowing them to practice and improve their skills. Additionally, users can learn from a range of available lessons, which cater to players of all skill levels, from beginners to advanced.

* The platform also provides the option to browse and purchase lesson packages tailored to individual interests. Users can select from a list of available chess instructors and book lessons based on their preferences. The website is designed with a focus on both learning and playing, giving users the opportunity to challenge themselves by playing chess against a computer opponent. The skill level of the AI can be adjusted to match the player's ability, providing a tailored experience for players of all levels.

* One of the most powerful features of the site is the integration of the Stockfish chess engine, which allows users to analyze their games. This gives players insights into their mistakes and areas for improvement, making it a valuable tool for learning from past games.

* On the homepage, the site displays chess-related articles fetched from an external website via RSS (Really Simple Syndication). RSS allows the site to automatically pull and display the latest articles from trusted sources, ensuring users have access to up-to-date chess news and learning resources without needing to visit multiple websites.

* This platform was developed with my chess students in mind, aiming to provide them with the resources and tools they need to enhance their chess skills both during and outside of lessons. With engaging puzzles, customizable lessons, and powerful analysis tools, this website serves as an all-in-one chess learning and playing environment.
